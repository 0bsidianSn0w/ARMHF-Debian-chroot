on my computer I use this to compile stuff for kindle but you could pobably put it on a kindle, idk, heres the guide
Its for arch btw, you can adapt it for debian though (ask ChatGPT)

## **Guide: Create Debian ARM Rootfs on Arch Linux**

### **Step 1: Install Required Packages**

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm debootstrap qemu-user-static binfmt-support
```

* **debootstrap** – Creates a minimal Debian filesystem.
* **qemu-user-static** – Emulates ARM CPU for chrooting.
* **binfmt-support** – Enables automatic execution of foreign binaries.

---

### **Step 2: Create a Target Directory for the Rootfs**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/debian-armhf
```

---

### **Step 3: Bootstrap Debian ARM Rootfs**

```bash
sudo debootstrap --arch=armhf --foreign bookworm ~/debian-armhf http://deb.debian.org/debian/
```

---

### **Step 4: Copy QEMU Static Binary**

```bash
sudo cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static ~/debian-armhf/usr/bin/
```

* This allows the host system to execute ARM binaries inside the chroot.

---

### **Step 5: Complete the Bootstrap in Chroot**

```bash
sudo chroot ~/debian-armhf /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /bin/bash
/debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage
```

---

### **Step 6: Basic Rootfs Configuration**

Inside the chroot:

1. **Set hostname**

```bash
echo "debian-armhf" > /etc/hostname
```

2. **Set up apt sources**

```bash
cat > /etc/apt/sources.list <<EOF
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib non-free
EOF
```

3. **Update packages**

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

4. **Set root password**

```bash
passwd
```

---

### **Step 7: Exit Chroot and Clean Up**

```bash
exit
```

* At this point, you have two options regarding the QEMU binary:

1. **Remove QEMU for a clean ARM rootfs**

```bash
sudo rm ~/debian-armhf/usr/bin/qemu-arm-static
```

* This is useful if you plan to deploy the rootfs to an actual ARM device, like a Kindle, for chrooting.

2. **Keep QEMU for easier cross-compilation or testing**

* Leaving `qemu-arm-static` in the rootfs allows you to chroot and run ARM binaries on your x86 Arch host without extra setup.

---

### **Step 8: Using the ARM Rootfs**

* **Chroot on Arch**:

```bash
sudo chroot ~/debian-armhf /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /bin/bash
```

* **Deploy to ARM device**: Copy the rootfs to the device and adjust `/etc/fstab` and networking.
* **Use in Docker or LXC**: Tar the rootfs and import as an image.

---

✅ You now have a fully functional **Debian ARM rootfs**, ready for chrooting, cross-compilation, or deployment to an ARM device like a Kindle.

If you want, I can make a **small diagram showing “Arch host → QEMU → Debian ARM rootfs” workflow** so the process is easier to visualize. This is especially handy for guides targeting ARM devices. Do you want me to do that?
